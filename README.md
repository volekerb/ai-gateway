# Requirements for LLM Gateway

## Key Features

### 1. Unified API
- **Description**: Provides a single, consistent interface for interacting with multiple LLM providers.
- **Use Case**: A customer service chatbot switches between LLMs based on query complexity. Developers can use the same code structure to call any LLM by simply changing a parameter.
- **Benefits**: Saves time and reduces codebase complexity.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **Description**: Manages access control to LLM services, ensuring only authorized users or applications can make requests.
- **Features**:
  - **API Key Management**: Stores and rotates API keys for LLM providers.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests per user or application to prevent abuse.
  - **Audit Logging**: Tracks access details (who, when, what, and why) for compliance in regulated industries.
- **Use Case**: Role-based access for internal tools in a company. HR's resume screening tool and a customer service chatbot access different models with seamless authentication managed by the gateway.

### 3. Caching
- **Description**: Stores responses to common queries to reduce API calls and improve response times.
- **Use Case**: A movie recommendation system caches popular film requests, serving repeat queries instantly without additional API calls.
- **Benefits**: Reduces costs and improves user experience with faster responses.

### 4. Usage Tracking and Analytics
- **Description**: Monitors and reports on LLM usage, costs, and performance metrics.
- **Use Case**: A company tracks token usage across multiple AI projects to determine which projects consume the most resources and which models perform best.
- **Benefits**: Informed decisions on resource allocation and model selection.

### 5. Custom Pre and Post Processing
- **Description**: Allows custom logic before sending requests to LLMs and after receiving responses.
- **Use Case**: A legal document analysis tool removes sensitive data before sending it to the LLM and reinserts it after receiving the response.
- **Benefits**: Ensures compliance with data protection regulations while simplifying application logic.

### 6. Load Balancing
- **Description**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances or providers to optimize performance and resource utilization.
- **Use Case**: A grammar-checking tool handles thousands of requests per minute during peak hours. The gateway balances the load across multiple LLM instances or providers.
- **Benefits**: Prevents overloads and maintains fast response times.

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Description**: Provides detailed logs, request tracing, and debugging tools to identify and resolve issues in LLM interactions.
- **Use Case**: A financial analysis tool team debugs inconsistent outputs by:
  - Accessing detailed logs (timestamps, model versions, processing steps).
  - Tracing specific queries through the gateway.
  - Viewing exact prompts sent to the LLM.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies debugging and improves reliability of LLM interactions.
